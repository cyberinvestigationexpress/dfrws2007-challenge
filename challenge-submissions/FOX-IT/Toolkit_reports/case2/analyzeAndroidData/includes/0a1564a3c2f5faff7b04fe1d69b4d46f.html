<br>So, a guy walks into a bar in the strip district ...</blockquote><div><br></div><div>That guy was me. Last night. All night. OMG I can barely move my eyes in my head without this cascade of pain and nausea.</div><div>
<br></div><div>I was going to be a good boy. I went home a little early, but I had a bunch of docs to review in my inbox. Then, that freakin outage thing hit. No way that was announced. I don&#39;t buy this planned outage thing. Anyway. Frustrating. So, I decided to kill some time and forget about things. Went to Boomerang BBQ &amp; Pizza and then walked on down to Mullaney&#39;s. I don&#39;t remember much else. Except this cute girl from McKee&#39;s Rocks slapped me for some reason.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Anyway, I know you were going to work all weekend. But since you probably don&#39;t have anything to work with either ... wanna come along for a sequel 2nite? Best way I know to cure what ails me.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Peace out,</div><div>LLancer</div><div><br></div>
